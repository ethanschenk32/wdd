            Hey everybody, my name is Ethan. The degree I am looking into going into is Computer science. Some of the hobbies I like to do are sports of all kind, and spending time with my family. I am married to my wonderful wife Madi. We have been married for 3 years now, and have two little dudes named, Maverick, and Brooks. I feel like learning web design is important in any career. The way the world is going everything is going to be online eventually. I will hopefully use this to further my knowledge for the future. I have been a member for my entire life. And my favorite scripture is Ether, 12, 27. I am eager to learn the things in this class to further my knowledge on the subject.
